      <div class="section_data" data-sectionid="2" style="display:none;"><p>A vaporizer is a device used to release the active ingredients of plant material or to release the therapeutic compounds. A healthier alternative to smoking, vaporizers heat the material at a much lower temperature (when compared to smoking) so that the active compounds contained in the plant material produce an aromatic vapor (instead of smoke). Rather than burning the plant material, which can produce numerous harmful by-products, this vapor contains virtually zero particulate matter and significantly reduced noxious gases. By avoiding combustion (smoke), the user is able to achieve the same desired effects without the harmful side-effects of smoking.<br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="//www.youtube.com/embed/LLAUt_94Ax8" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen style="box-shadow:0px 0px 11px rgba(1, 1, 1, 0.5); margin-top:5px;;"></iframe></p></div>

      <div class="section_data" data-sectionid="3" style="display:none;">
         <p>There are three main types of vaporizers: desktops, portables, and pens-style units.</p>
         <p><b>Desktop:</b> The original and most powerful vaporizers, desktops (or tabletop) units require a connection to a standard wall outlet, and are available in three different types: whip-style, forced air and multifunctional.</p>
         <p><b>Portable:</b> Powered by rechargeable lithium-ion batteries, portable (or handheld) units are lightweight and designed to be carried with you and used on-the-go.</p>
         <p><b>Pen:</b> Pen-style units are super-slim and very discreet. However, even though these are often referred to as "vape pens", it's important to know that these units aren't true vaporizers, as they allow plant material to come into direct contact with their heating element.</p>

      <div class="section_title" data-sectionid="4">How do vaporizers work?</div>
      <div class="section_data" data-sectionid="4" style="display:none;">
         <p>Vaporizers operate on the basis of convection heating. To understand this, it's important to familiarize yourself with three very important terms that we commonly refer to as "The Three C's": Convection, Conduction & Combustion.</p>
         <p><b>Convection:</b> Convection is a type of heating method employed by true vaporizers. With convection, herbal material does not come into direct contact with the heat source. Instead, vaporization is achieved by heated air passing over and through the herbs, extracting the active ingredients without burning them. Convection is the basis of vaporization, and is a very important process to understand.</p>
         <p><b>Conduction:</b> Conduction is another type of heating method, and is essentially the opposite of convection. With conduction, herbal material comes into direct contact with the heat source (flame or heating coil), resulting in the burning and charring of the herbs - thus producing smoke, not vapor. It is important to know the differences between conduction and convection, as conduction is a process not conducive to vaporization.</p>

         <p><b>Combustion:</b> Quite simply, combustion is the process of burning something. When plant material comes into direct contact with a heat source (flame or heating coil), it ignites, burns, and creates smoke. Combustion is the opposite of vaporization, as vaporizers are designed to prevent this process from occurring.</p>

      <div class="section_title" data-sectionid="5">Why do people vaporize?</div>
      <div class="section_data" data-sectionid="5" style="display:none;">
         <p><b>Health:</b> When smoking, combustion occurs, which damages the lungs. The respiratory hazards of smoke are due to toxic by-products of combustion, not the active ingredients in the herb. It has been proven that inhaling smoke through the process of combustion can lead to lung cancer and many other respiratory disorders. Holding in smoke after inhaling absorbs even more tar and noxious chemicals into the lungs.<br><br>By contrast, vaporization is the process of heating plant material just below the point of combustion. This process extracts the full-flavor, active compounds and purity of the plant material without creating smoke or releasing harmful by-products. Vaporizing emits a vapor that is 95% smoke and carcinogen-free. With vaporization, you only need to take small, shallow puffs to get noticeable therapeutic effects. Not only is vaporizing healthier for you.</p>
         <img src="images/learning_center/Smoking-v-Vaporizing.jpg">
         <p><b>Flavor:</b> Because the material being vaporized is being heated and not burned, the original flavor is maintained, resulting in a much more satisfying experience.<br><br>Let's say you put one marshmallow in a microwave for thirty seconds, and you take another marshmallow and stick it directly into a flame for thirty seconds - causing it to ignite and burn. Which marshmallow would taste better? The one that is nice and warm from the microwave, or the one that is completely charred and black from the flame?</p>
         <p><b>Efficiency:</b> Vaporizing is also a great way to conserve your herbs. A very small amount of planet material goes a long way in a vaporizer, when compared to packing the same amount in a pipe or bong.</p>
         <p>If you take a "pinch" of dry herb, pack it into a pipe or bong, and then take a lighter to it - within seconds the plant material will burn completely and get sucked through the bowl - resulting in very little smoke or "medicated" feeling. However, if you pack the same amount of dry herb into a vaporizer, not only will the session last longer (because the herbs are being slowly heated and not "flash" burned), but you will also experience much more of the medicinal value.</p>
         <p><b>Discreetness:</b> One of the biggest draws of vaporizers (at least the portable variety) is the fact that they allow you to quickly and discreetly enjoy herbs while you're out and about in public.</p>
         <p>When compared to smoking a pipe in public, vaporizers are much more discreet, as the process of drawing from a vaporizer is far less obvious than smoking a pipe. Additionally, the odor from vapor is much more subtle than that of smoke. It's very likely that you've been near someone using a vaporizer before and didn't even know it.</p>
         <p><b>Convenience:</b> Similar to discreetness, the convenience factor that vaporizers provide allow you to enjoy herbs in places and settings that you might not otherwise be able to.</p>
         <p>You're hanging out at the beach with some friends on a beautiful summer day - what better time to medicate?! However, the wind is picking up, making it impossible to keep the flame of your lighter lit. This is the perfect situation to use a vaporizer, as they heat internally, and don't require a lighter or flame.</p>

      <div class="section_title" data-sectionid="6">What is the optimal temperature for vaporizing?</div>
      <div class="section_data" data-sectionid="6" style="display:none;">
         <p>The standard temperature for vaporizing dry herb ranges between 350&#176; and 395&#176;, with 375&#176; being commonly referred to as the "goldilocks zone", as it produces fairly thick vapor while still staying well below the point of combustion (around 400&#176;F). However, each vaporizer is different and has its own optimal temperature. Finding the perfect temperature takes a little work and it can vary with the specific material being vaporized. Drier herb will begin vaporizing at a lower temp, whereas a moister herb will require more heat to produce vapor.</p>
         <p>Starting at a lower temperature and slowly raising it releases a range of effects as different active ingredients vaporize off with each increase. Everyone has their own personal preference and this should be considered as a guide to find the best temperature to start with.</p>

               <div class="section_data" data-sectionid="2" style="display:none;"><p>A vaporizer is a device used to release the active ingredients of plant material or to release the therapeutic compounds. A healthier alternative to smoking, vaporizers heat the material at a much lower temperature (when compared to smoking) so that the active compounds contained in the plant material produce an aromatic vapor (instead of smoke). Rather than burning the plant material, which can produce numerous harmful by-products, this vapor contains virtually zero particulate matter and significantly reduced noxious gases. By avoiding combustion (smoke), the user is able to achieve the same desired effects without the harmful side-effects of smoking.<br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="//www.youtube.com/embed/LLAUt_94Ax8" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen style="box-shadow:0px 0px 11px rgba(1, 1, 1, 0.5); margin-top:5px;;"></iframe></p></div>

               <div class="section_data" data-sectionid="3" style="display:none;">
                  <p>There are three main types of vaporizers: desktops, portables, and pens-style units.</p>
                  <p><b>Desktop:</b> The original and most powerful vaporizers, desktops (or tabletop) units require a connection to a standard wall outlet, and are available in three different types: whip-style, forced air and multifunctional.</p>
                  <p><b>Portable:</b> Powered by rechargeable lithium-ion batteries, portable (or handheld) units are lightweight and designed to be carried with you and used on-the-go.</p>
                  <p><b>Pen:</b> Pen-style units are super-slim and very discreet. However, even though these are often referred to as "vape pens", it's important to know that these units aren't true vaporizers, as they allow plant material to come into direct contact with their heating element.</p>
            	</div>
            </li>
            <li class="clickable">
               <div class="section_title" data-sectionid="4">How do vaporizers work?</div>
               <div class="section_data" data-sectionid="4" style="display:none;">
                  <p>Vaporizers operate on the basis of convection heating. To understand this, it's important to familiarize yourself with three very important terms that we commonly refer to as "The Three C's": Convection, Conduction & Combustion.</p>
                  <p><b>Convection:</b> Convection is a type of heating method employed by true vaporizers. With convection, herbal material does not come into direct contact with the heat source. Instead, vaporization is achieved by heated air passing over and through the herbs, extracting the active ingredients without burning them. Convection is the basis of vaporization, and is a very important process to understand.</p>
                  <p><b>Conduction:</b> Conduction is another type of heating method, and is essentially the opposite of convection. With conduction, herbal material comes into direct contact with the heat source (flame or heating coil), resulting in the burning and charring of the herbs - thus producing smoke, not vapor. It is important to know the differences between conduction and convection, as conduction is a process not conducive to vaporization.</p>
                  <img src="images/learning_center/Convection-Image.jpg"><img src="images/learning_center/Conduction-Image.jpg">
                  <p><b>Combustion:</b> Quite simply, combustion is the process of burning something. When plant material comes into direct contact with a heat source (flame or heating coil), it ignites, burns, and creates smoke. Combustion is the opposite of vaporization, as vaporizers are designed to prevent this process from occurring.</p>
            	</div>
            </li>
            <li class="clickable">
               <div class="section_title" data-sectionid="5">Why do people vaporize?</div>
               <div class="section_data" data-sectionid="5" style="display:none;">
                  <p><b>Health:</b> When smoking, combustion occurs, which damages the lungs. The respiratory hazards of smoke are due to toxic by-products of combustion, not the active ingredients in the herb. It has been proven that inhaling smoke through the process of combustion can lead to lung cancer and many other respiratory disorders. Holding in smoke after inhaling absorbs even more tar and noxious chemicals into the lungs.<br><br>By contrast, vaporization is the process of heating plant material just below the point of combustion. This process extracts the full-flavor, active compounds and purity of the plant material without creating smoke or releasing harmful by-products. Vaporizing emits a vapor that is 95% smoke and carcinogen-free. With vaporization, you only need to take small, shallow puffs to get noticeable therapeutic effects. Not only is vaporizing healthier for you.</p>
                  <img src="images/learning_center/Smoking-v-Vaporizing.jpg">
                  <p><b>Flavor:</b> Because the material being vaporized is being heated and not burned, the original flavor is maintained, resulting in a much more satisfying experience.<br><br>Let's say you put one marshmallow in a microwave for thirty seconds, and you take another marshmallow and stick it directly into a flame for thirty seconds - causing it to ignite and burn. Which marshmallow would taste better? The one that is nice and warm from the microwave, or the one that is completely charred and black from the flame?</p>
                  <p><b>Efficiency:</b> Vaporizing is also a great way to conserve your herbs. A very small amount of planet material goes a long way in a vaporizer, when compared to packing the same amount in a pipe or bong.</p>
                  <p>If you take a "pinch" of dry herb, pack it into a pipe or bong, and then take a lighter to it - within seconds the plant material will burn completely and get sucked through the bowl - resulting in very little smoke or "medicated" feeling. However, if you pack the same amount of dry herb into a vaporizer, not only will the session last longer (because the herbs are being slowly heated and not "flash" burned), but you will also experience much more of the medicinal value.</p>
                  <p><b>Discreetness:</b> One of the biggest draws of vaporizers (at least the portable variety) is the fact that they allow you to quickly and discreetly enjoy herbs while you're out and about in public.</p>
                  <p>When compared to smoking a pipe in public, vaporizers are much more discreet, as the process of drawing from a vaporizer is far less obvious than smoking a pipe. Additionally, the odor from vapor is much more subtle than that of smoke. It's very likely that you've been near someone using a vaporizer before and didn't even know it.</p>
                  <p><b>Convenience:</b> Similar to discreetness, the convenience factor that vaporizers provide allow you to enjoy herbs in places and settings that you might not otherwise be able to.</p>
                  <p>You're hanging out at the beach with some friends on a beautiful summer day - what better time to medicate?! However, the wind is picking up, making it impossible to keep the flame of your lighter lit. This is the perfect situation to use a vaporizer, as they heat internally, and don't require a lighter or flame.</p>

            <li class="clickable">
               <div class="section_title" data-sectionid="6">What is the optimal temperature for vaporizing?</div>
               <div class="section_data" data-sectionid="6" style="display:none;">
               	<p>The standard temperature for vaporizing dry herb ranges between 350&#176; and 395&#176;, with 375&#176; being commonly referred to as the "goldilocks zone", as it produces fairly thick vapor while still staying well below the point of combustion (around 400&#176;F). However, each vaporizer is different and has its own optimal temperature. Finding the perfect temperature takes a little work and it can vary with the specific material being vaporized. Drier herb will begin vaporizing at a lower temp, whereas a moister herb will require more heat to produce vapor.</p>
               	<p>Starting at a lower temperature and slowly raising it releases a range of effects as different active ingredients vaporize off with each increase. Everyone has their own personal preference and this should be considered as a guide to find the best temperature to start with.</p>

            <li class="clickable">
               <div class="section_title" data-sectionid="7">What is a Desktop Vaporizer?</div>
               <div class="section_data" data-sectionid="7" style="display:none;"><p>Desktop vaporizers are designed for home use and plugin to any wall outlet. Since they first appeared on the market over fifteen years ago, desktops have evolved from simple, no-frills box-style devices that utilize whips to draw vapor, to versatile digital units that can include powerful internal fans and allow users to choose between standard whip draw and advanced balloon bag inhalation methods.</p>
               	<p>Most people would agree that desktop units provide the greatest amount of vapor production, as well as the most efficient vaporization experience. Desktop units are perfect for those who will mainly be vaporizing at home. While portable vapes may be more versatile than desktops, they can’t compare when it comes to performance and efficiency.</p>

               <div class="section_data" data-sectionid="8" style="display:none;">
                  <p>All desktop vaporizers heat material though convection, making them the preferred units of people who use vaporizers primarily for the health benefits. Depending on the type of desktop, heated air is either drawn manually or propelled automatically from the heating element through the material being vaporized. </p>
               </div>
            </li>         
            <li class="clickable">
               <div class="section_title" data-sectionid="9">Different Types of Desktop Vaporizers</div>
               <div class="section_data" data-sectionid="9" style="display:none;">
               <p>Desktop vaporizers come in two different styles: <b>whip-style</b> or <b>forced-air</b>. Whip-style vaporizers utilize a piece of medical grade tubing called a "whip" to inhale vapor as it’s drawn from the heating element. Forced air vaporizers are a bit more advanced, and utilize a fan that propels the heat over your herbs and fills a balloon bag or whip attachment with vapor. Some desktop vaporizers are referred to as "dual-function," and are capable of both a forced air and whip-style delivery.</p>
                  <h3>Whip Style</h3>
                     <p>Whip-style vaporizers utilize a "whip" attachment as their means of drawing vapor. A whip is comprised of three main parts - the wand (glass piece where herb is packed), the tubing (typically medical-grade silicon) and the mouthpiece (which is usually glass). When using a whip-style unit, the user is able to pull hot air over the herbs and create a steady stream of vapor as they inhale. Whip-style devices are very popular, as they’re extremely easy to use and one of the most affordable types of vaporizers.</p>
                     <p>Most of these vaporizers utilize a hands free connection, which allows for seamless vapor consumption without having to hold the whip attachment in place. These vapes use a ground glass wand to achieve the hands free connection, and provide a more enjoyable vaporizing experience. In addition to being hands free, ground glass wands also provide airtight seals, which increases overall vapor production and efficiency. </p>
                     <p>Although all units come with their own whip attachment, they can be swapped out for others that are compatible. All whips function in pretty much the same way, but tend to vary in things like size, glass thickness, design and color.</p>
                     <p>While whip-style units are sometimes viewed as an "old-school" means of vaporization, newer models boast features such as precise temperature control, LCD displays as well as cutting-edge designs. These vapes are ideal for those looking for a simple, less technical way to vaporize.</p>
                  <h3>Forced-Air/ Balloon Bag</h3>
                     <p>Forced-air vaporizers represent the newest and most effective wave of vaporizers. These advanced devices utilize a forced-air system, meaning an internal fan propels hot air over your herbs, heating them by way of convection heating. This process creates a perfect vapor stream that can be drawn through a whip attachment, or filled into a balloon bag - depending on the type of vaporizer. Many of these units also feature varying fan settings, allowing the user to control the speed of the hot air flow. </p>
                     <p>Desktops that utilize forced-air technology are viewed as the most effective and healthy means of vaporization. Forced-air units are able to pump out vapor on their own, whereas standard whip-style vaporizers require the user to inhale (draw) for vapor to be produced. Once herbs are warmed through convection, the units’ internal fan continues to propel the vapor either into a balloon bag or through a whip attachment, allowing for the most seamless vaporization experience possible.</p>
                     <p>While all forced-air vaporizers function somewhat similarly, things like size, heat-up time, temperature range, vapor delivery system and overall quality vary from unit to unit. Vapes that use forced-air technology tend to perform better than standard whip-style vaporizers, and are typically considered to be higher quality. While standard whip-style units offer a quick and simple means of dry herb vaporization, they can’t compete with the type of vapor production associated with forced-air units.</p>
                  <h3>Multifunction</h3>
                     <p>Desktop vaporizers that feature both whip-draw and forced-air/balloon bag inhalation methods are referred to as Multifunction units, and are the most versatile types of vaporizers. In addition to offering both whip and balloon bag functionality, many multifunction desktops are equipped with multiple fan speed options, and allow users to use the unit in whip-draw mode with or without the use of the internal fan.</p>
                  <h3>Other</h3>
                  <p>There are a small number of desktop vaporizers that are a little more difficult to classify. These units can essentially be classified as whip-style units, as they do not have internal fans, they do not utilize traditional silicone whips. Instead, these units come equipped with extended glass draw-stems or stainless steel heating coils which act as whips, since they draw vapor from the heating chamber to the mouthpiece.</p>

         	<p>Desktop vaporizers feature one of two temperature control methods: <b>Digital</b> or <b>Analog.</b></p>
            <p>Regardless of the type of temperature control a desktop vaporizer employs, monitoring the temperature throughout the process of vaporization is important, as it will help prevent the material from being overheated, which leads to combustion and smoke. The remaining herb should be crispy and a brownish color, NOT ash. If the leftover product is black, burnt or charred, a lower temperature should be used.</p>
            <h3>Digital</h3>
            <p>Desktop units that utilize digital temperature control feature a digital display and +/- buttons which allow you to easily adjust the temperature. Digital desktops are typically more expensive that analog units, and also tend to be more popular among consumers.</p>
            <p>Because digital units are able to be precisely adjusted in single degree increments, they offer more accurate temperature control. Another nice feature of units with digital displays is they usually display two temperatures: the current temp and the set temp. This gives you a better idea of how close the unit is to reaching the set heat level, and when it will be ready to use.</p>
            <h3>Analong</h3>
            <p>Units with analog temperature control either utilize a dial which can be rotated to the preferred heat setting, or a simple on/off switch. Desktop units equipped with analog temperature control typically cost less than those that are digital, as they don’t offer as precise control.</p>
            <p>Some units, like the Volcano Classic, have temperature markings around the dial, which make it easy to find and set to the optimal setting. </p>
            <p>However, most analog desktops, like Da Buddha, Silver Surfer and Vapor Brothers, do not bear any markings, which make it more difficult to control. It’s common for people to refer to settings on a unit that utilizes a dial with no markings like they would to time on a lock. For example, if the maximum temperature is 400°F, and you turn the dial 375°F, you would refer to that setting as 9 O‘clock.</p>

<h2>Chapter 3: Portable Vaporizers</h2>

         <div class="section_title" data-sectionid="12">What is a Portable Vaporizer</div>
         <div class="section_data" data-sectionid="12" style="display:none;">
         <p>Ideal for on-the-go sessions, portable vaporizers are devices that allow you to vaporize on-the-go. Utilizing compact and durable designs that are conducive to road-use, portables typically offer multiple temperature options and heat settings. By combining pocket-sized convenience with advanced heating systems and enhanced versatility, portable vaporizers have become the preferred method of cannabis consumption for many people looking for a healthier alternative to traditional means. While portable vaporizers can’t quite match the power and dependability of desktop units, they do provide a quick and convenient way to medicate in a multitude of different situations and settings.</p>

         </li>
         

   <li class="clickable">
         <div class="section_title" data-sectionid="13">How Do Portable Vaporizers Work?</div>
         <div class="section_data" data-sectionid="13" style="display:none;">
         <p>Unlike pen-style units that burn material by conduction, portable vaporizers are just that – actual vaporizers – which essentially “cook” loaded material through convection (although oftentimes combined with an element of conduction). Since the packed material never comes into direct contact with the heating element, very little combustion takes place, resulting in true vapor and minimal smoke.</p>
         <h3>Getting Started</h3>
         <p>The heating chamber (also referred to as an herb chamber or oven) is the area of the vaporizer in which dry blends are packed. Heating chambers can be constructed from many different materials, including stainless steel, ceramic or even glass. The material from which the chamber is constructed from will ultimately have an effect on the taste and consistency of the vapor produced.</p>
         <p>When packing herbs into the chamber, it’s best to finely grind your dry material, packing the chamber full – but not tight.  Leaving the pack loose enough allows air to flow freely through the herbs and heat them evenly.</p>
         <h3>Temperatue Settings / Heat Options</h3>
         <p>Now that the chamber is packed full of green goodness, it’s time to set your vape to the optimal temperature. Heat settings differ from unit to unit, but for the most part, they usually fall between 300° - 400°F. Depending on the device, there can be as few as one preset optimized heat setting, or upwards to ten on more advanced units. While many (perhaps most) portables come equipped with several different heat settings (usually signified by different colored LED lights), there are many units nowadays that offer precise digital temperature control, allowing for a finely tailored vaporization experience.</p>
         <p>A few different factors should be taken into account when deciding on what temperature at which to vaporize. Lower temperatures are associated with light vapor, and are ideal for herbs with low moisture levels. At lower temperatures, vapor clouds won’t be as large or pronounced, but the effects will still be felt. </p>
